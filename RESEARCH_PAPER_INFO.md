## üìä Key Research Findings

### Performance Rankings
| Rank | Cipher | Throughput | Status |
|------|--------|-----------|--------|
| ü•á 1st | AES-ECB | 386.96 MB/s | Fastest (insecure) |
| ü•à 2nd | AES-CBC | 393.22 MB/s | **RECOMMENDED** |
| ü•â 3rd | AES-CFB | 29.41 MB/s | Stream mode |
| 4th | 3DES-ECB | 38.76 MB/s | Legacy |
| 5th | 3DES-CBC | 36.98 MB/s | Legacy |
| 6th | 3DES-CFB | 4.68 MB/s | Legacy, slow |
| 7th | SaltedCipher-CFB | 5.08 MB/s | Educational |
| 8th | SaltedCipher-CBC | 5.12 MB/s | Educational |

### Key Conclusions
- AES is **100x faster** than SaltedCipher
- AES is **10x faster** than 3DES
- AES-CBC provides optimal balance (393.22 MB/s + excellent security)
- ECB mode is deterministic and unsuitable for sensitive data
- Hardware acceleration (AES-NI) makes AES dominant
